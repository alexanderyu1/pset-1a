  <h1> The Three Weapons </h1>

	<h2> Introduction </h2>

	<p>
		The three weapons in fencing are Foil, Epee, and Sabre. These three weapons
		all have drastically different playstyles, equipment, and rules. In fact,
		the only thing that stays consistent between the three weapons is footwork.
		For example, a foil fencer who switched to Sabre would be considered a
		beginner in all aspects except footwork.

	<h2> Foil </h2>

	<p>
		Foil is one of the three weapons in fencing. The foil weapon resembles a
		flexible metal stick with a button at the tip. When the blade is stabbed
		into a fencer, the button is compressed at a light connected to the blade
		goes off, indicating that that fencer has scored a touch. Foil is known as a
		point weapon, as one can only score by hitting with the point. Above is an
		image highlighting the areas which can be touched to receive a point. If
		a touch lands anywhere on the body not in the target area, then it is
		called an off-target. Foil fencers wear a vest interwoven with metal threads,
		called a lamé. The lamé is connected to a system of wires and lights, the same
		system the weapon is connected to. If the foil hits the lamé, the electrical
		circuit between the two fencers is completed and a light will appear indicating
		that the touch was on target. If the tip compresses but does not complete
		the circuit with the lamé, then the off-target light will appear. Basically,
		it is just a system to determine whether the fencer hit on target or not. If
		both fencers hit at the same time, the referee will decide who gets the point
		using "right of way." Right of way will be further explained in the Basic Rules
		page. Generally, Foil is medium paced, with some slow moments and some fast ones.

	<h2> Epee </h2>

	<p>
		Epee is one of the three weapons in fencing. The Epee weapon is similar to the
		Foil in that it is also a point weapon, but the Epee is much stiffer and heavier
		than the Foil. Above is an image highlighting the target area; as you can see,
		the target area is the entire body. Instead of wearing a lamé, Epee fencers will
		just wear the standard white uniform. Epee is the only weapon in which double
		touches can be scored. No right of way exists in Epee. Generally, Epee is the
		slowest paced weapon of the three. Epee bouts frequently run out of time.
