		  <h1> The Three Weapons </h1>

			<h2> Introduction </h2>

			<p>
				The three weapons in fencing are Foil, Epee, and Sabre. These three weapons
				all have drastically different playstyles, equipment, and rules. In fact,
				the only thing that stays consistent between the three weapons is footwork.
				For example, a foil fencer who switched to Sabre would be considered a
				beginner in all aspects except footwork.

				<br>
				Foil is one of the three weapons in fencing. The foil weapon resembles a
				flexible metal stick with a button at the tip. When the blade is stabbed
				into a fencer, the button is compressed at a light connected to the blade
				goes off, indicating that that fencer has scored a touch. Foil is known as a
				point weapon, as one can only score by hitting with the point. Above is an
				image highlighting the areas which can be touched to receive a point. If
				a touch lands anywhere on the body not in the target area, then it is
				called an off-target. Foil fencers wear a vest interwoven with metal threads,
				called a lamé. The lamé is connected to a system of wires and lights, the same
				system the weapon is connected to. If the foil hits the lamé, the electrical
				circuit between the two fencers is completed and a light will appear indicating
				that the touch was on target. If the tip compresses but does not complete
				the circuit with the lamé, then the off-target light will appear. Basically,
				it is just a system to determine whether the fencer hit on target or not. If
				both fencers hit at the same time, the referee will decide who gets the point
				using "right of way." Right of way will be further explained in the Basic Rules
				page. Generally, Foil is medium paced, with some slow moments and some fast ones.

			<h4> Epee </h4>

				<br>
				<br>
				Epee is the second of the three weapons in fencing. The Epee weapon is similar to the
				Foil in that it is also a point weapon, but the Epee is much stiffer and heavier
				than the Foil. Above is an image highlighting the target area; as you can see,
				the target area is the entire body. Instead of wearing a lamé, Epee fencers will
				just wear the standard white uniform. Epee is the only weapon in which double
				touches can be scored. No right of way exists in Epee. Generally, Epee is the
				slowest paced weapon of the three. Epee bouts frequently run out of time.

				<br>
				<br>
				Sabre is the last of the three weapons in fencing. The Sabre weapon is not a
				point weapon. If any part of the blade, including the side, comes in contact with
				the opponent, then a touch will be scored. This allows for slashing and cutting
				actions in Sabre, compared to only stabbing actions in Foil and Epee. The target area
				for Sabre is the entire upper body, not including the hands or wrists. Since the head
				is also a target area in Sabre, Sabre fencers wear a special conductive mask that has
				a wire attached to the lamé. Sabre has right of way, but this right of way is different
				from Foil's right of way in a few technical aspects. Since it is so easy to score
				touches in Sabre, Sabre is the fastest paced weapon of the three. Bouts are so fast
				that directors do not even bother to keep a timer for rounds.
