										weapons, advances are one way to take right of way. </li>
										<li> <b>Retreat</b> - The basic backwards movement. Used to get out of range
											of the opponent when they are attacking or advancing. </li>
											<li> <b>Lunge</b> - The basic attacking movement. In a lunge, the back leg
												pushes the body forward as the front leg extends. The fencer lands on the front
												leg. This move is used to cover distance quickly. </li>

																has right of way. There are many ways to gain and lose right of way.
																One can gain it by having continuous action forward, and by making
																blade contact with the opponent. One will give it up if they stop making
																continuous action forward and the opponent does, or if their opponent parries or beats
																their blade.

																	blade. </li>

																		to either make sure they have right of way or disrupt the opponent's blade. </li>
