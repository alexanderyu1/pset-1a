	<h1> Basic Terminology </h1>

			<ol>
				<li> <b>Whites</b> - Basic white uniform that every fencer must wear. Its
					main job is to protect the fencer from the weapon. </li>
					<li> <b>Lamé</b> - A conductive vest used in Foil and Sabre to register
						touches in the valid target area. </li>
						<li> <b>Epee</b> - Heaviest of the three weapons. Traingular blade and
							has a large bell guard. </li>
							<li> <b>Foil</b> - Has a rectangular blade, with a small bell guard. </li>
								<li> <b>Sabre</b> - Has a flat blade with a bell guard that wraps around
									the knuckles. </li>
									<li> <b>Advance</b> - The basic forward movement. In the right of way
										weapons, advances are one way to take right of way. </li>
										<li> <b>Retreat</b> - The basic backwards movement. Used to get out of range
											of the opponent when they are attacking or advancing. </li>
											<li> <b>Lunge</b> - The basic attacking movement. In a lunge, the back leg
												pushes the body forward as the front leg extends. The fencer lands on the front
												leg. This move is used to cover distance quickly. </li>
												<li> <b>En garde</b> - Spoken by the director to tell the fencers
													to get into positions at the start of a bout. </li>
													<li> <b>Bout</b> - A match between two fencers. </li>
													  <li> <b>Strip</b> - The area in which the fencers fence.
															It is 14 meters long and 2 meters wide. If any fencer goes off
															the strip, the action is stopped. </li>
															<li> <b>Right of way</b> - The first to establish a threat to the target
																has right of way. There are many ways to gain and lose right of way.
																One can gain it by having continuous action forward, and by making
																blade contact with the opponent. One will give it up if they stop making
																continuous action forward and the opponent does, or if their opponent parries or beats
																their blade.
																<li> <b>Parry</b> - A defensive action using the blade to deflect the opponents
																	blade. </li>
																	<li> <b>Beat</b> - Similar to a parry, but is instead performed during an attack
																		to either make sure they have right of way or disrupt the opponent's blade. </li>
																		<li> <b>Absence of Blade</b> - The attacking fencer will pull the blade out of range of the opponent's beat.
																			This allows the attacking fencer to advance without threat of a beat (a beat will give the defending fencer the right of way).
																			However, since the blade has been pulled back, the attacking fencer is more susceptible to counter-attacks. </li>
																			<li> <b>Point in Line</b> - The defending fencer raises their blade at the attacker, threatening with the point. This tactic overrides
																				right of way, so even if the attacking fencer has right of way, they will lose the point if they just run into the defending fencer's blade.
																				The attacking fencer must either wait for the defending fencer to lower their blade or beat the blade. </li>
